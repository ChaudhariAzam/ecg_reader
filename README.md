Project Description

The ECG Reader is a signal processing and analysis system designed to read, visualize, and analyze Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The project focuses on extracting meaningful cardiac information such as heart rate (BPM), detecting R-peaks, and identifying basic rhythm irregularities from ECG signals.

This system can process ECG data from files (such as CSV datasets) or real-time input from ECG sensors. It applies signal preprocessing techniques to remove noise, enhances waveform clarity, and performs peak detection to calculate heart rate and cardiac intervals.

The ECG Reader is designed for:

Medical data analysis practice

Biomedical signal processing learning

Healthcare monitoring prototypes

AI/ML-based arrhythmia detection research

The project demonstrates core concepts of:

Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

Biomedical waveform analysis

Peak detection algorithms

Data visualization

Optional machine learning integration for abnormal rhythm detection

This repository serves as a foundation for building advanced ECG monitoring systems, smart health assistants, or AI-powered cardiac analysis tools.
